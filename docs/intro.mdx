# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook** — your comprehensive guide to building and controlling embodied intelligence. This textbook is designed for beginners and intermediate learners who want to understand the fundamentals of Physical AI and the robotics systems that bring it to life.

## What You'll Learn

This textbook consists of 4 modules with 3 lessons each, progressing from foundational concepts to applied systems:

### **Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI**
Learn what Physical AI is, how it differs from software-only AI, and master the core concepts you'll need throughout this textbook.

### **Module 2: Embodied Intelligence & Robotics Core**
Dive into the hardware and systems that enable robots to perceive, act, and control their environment.

### **Module 3: Humanoid Robotics & AI Agents**
Explore the specialized challenges of humanoid design and how AI agents control complex physical systems.

### **Module 4: Applied Systems & AI-Native Learning**
Discover simulation-to-real transfer, the RAG chatbot integrated into this textbook, and personalization features.

## How to Use This Textbook
