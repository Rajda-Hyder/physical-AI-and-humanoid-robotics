# Lesson 2.3: Engaging with the Physical World

## Lesson Overview

You've learned about sensors (perception) and control systems (decision-making). Now comes the action: **how robots actually engage with the physical world**. Every interaction—whether rolling across a floor, reaching for an object, or navigating through crowds—involves understanding and overcoming the forces and constraints of physics.

Physical engagement is where abstract robot theory meets harsh reality. The real world doesn't care about your perfectly tuned PID controller if you don't account for friction, inertia, and gravity.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Understand** kinematics (motion without forces) and dynamics (motion with forces)
- **Explain** different locomotion strategies (wheels, legs, flying)
- **Describe** manipulation and grasping principles
- **Analyze** physical constraints and trade-offs in robot design
- **Apply** physics principles to predict and optimize robot behavior

## Core Concepts

### Kinematics: Understanding Motion

**Kinematics** describes how things move without considering forces. It answers "where will the robot be?" and "how do I move the arm to reach that point?"

#### Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics answers: **"If I rotate each joint by these amounts, where does the end-effector (hand/gripper) end up?"**

Example: A robot arm with two joints
```
Joint 1 angle: 45°
Joint 2 angle: 30°
→ Where is the gripper in space?
```

This is straightforward: Given the joint angles, calculate the 3D position.

#### Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics is harder: **"Where do I need to rotate each joint to move the gripper to THIS point in space?"**

Example: A robot arm and a cup to grab
```
Cup position: (x=0.3m, y=0, z=0.5m)
→ What joint angles get the gripper there?
```

This is mathematically more complex because there may be multiple solutions—or no solution if the point is unreachable.

#### Workspace and Reachability

Not every point in space is reachable by a robot arm. The **workspace** is the region that the arm can reach. Design constraints matter:

- **Reach**: How far can the arm extend?
- **Orientation**: Can the gripper rotate to any angle, or just some?
- **Singularities**: Positions where the arm loses degrees of freedom (dangerous!)

### Dynamics: Understanding Forces

**Dynamics** describes how forces cause motion and acceleration. It answers "what forces do I need to apply?" and "how much power does this motion require?"

#### Newton's Second Law in Robotics

```
F = m × a
```

For a robot:
- **F** = Force applied by actuator (torque for rotation)
- **m** = Mass of the moving object (or moment of inertia for rotation)
- **a** = Acceleration

**Implications**:
- A heavy robot arm needs strong (expensive) motors
- A fast acceleration needs high torque
- Longer arms have higher inertia and are harder to control

#### Friction and Resistance

Real robots encounter friction:
- **Static Friction**: The force needed to start movement (usually high)
- **Kinetic Friction**: The force resisting movement once it's started (usually lower)
- **Viscous Friction**: Resistance proportional to speed (like air resistance)

**Robot Design Impact**:
- Good bearings reduce friction (expensive but necessary for precision)
- Friction limits acceleration (you can't accelerate faster than friction allows without slipping)
- Friction is why robot joints heat up during fast movement

#### Power and Energy

Motors have limited power. Power is energy per unit time:

```
Power = Force × Velocity (for linear motion)
Power = Torque × Angular velocity (for rotation)
```

A robot that lifts a heavy object slowly might use the same power as a robot that lifts a light object quickly.

### Locomotion: How Robots Move

Different environments require different strategies.

#### Wheeled Locomotion

**Advantages**:
- Simple, efficient, fast
- Low energy for flat surfaces
- Easy to control

**Disadvantages**:
- Struggles with stairs and rough terrain
- Requires friction between wheel and ground
- Limited to engineered surfaces

**Types**:
- **Differential drive** (two wheels): Simple steering, used in robots like the Turtlebot
- **Omnidirectional wheels** (3+ wheels): Move in any direction, no turning needed
- **Skid steering** (tracked vehicles): Good traction, handles rough terrain

#### Legged Locomotion

**Advantages**:
- Navigates stairs, rough terrain
- More adaptable to obstacles
- Can stabilize on uneven surfaces

**Disadvantages**:
- Complex kinematics and dynamics
- Energy-intensive
- Slower than wheels on flat surfaces

**Types**:
- **Biped** (2 legs): Most efficient for stairs, but requires sophisticated balance (hard!)
- **Quadruped** (4 legs): Stable, efficient, good terrain adaptation
- **Hexapod** (6 legs): Very stable, good for rocky terrain

#### Aerial Locomotion (Drones)

**Advantages**:
- Bypass terrain entirely
- Access elevated positions
- Fast

**Disadvantages**:
- Energy-intensive (flying is hard!)
- Limited battery life
- Limited payload capacity

**Types**:
- **Fixed-wing**: Efficient, but needs speed to stay airborne
- **Multirotor** (quadcopter): Hover-capable, slower but more maneuverable

### Manipulation: Interacting with Objects

Robots often need to grasp, move, and manipulate objects. This is deceptively complex.

#### Grasping

A good grasp must:
1. **Be Stable**: The object doesn't slip or rotate
2. **Avoid Damage**: Especially important for soft objects (fruit, eggs, people)
3. **Be Achievable**: The robot can physically reach and achieve this grip

**Grasp Types**:
- **Power Grasp**: Maximum force, grip whole hand (like holding a baseball bat)
- **Precision Grasp**: Fine control, fingers working together (like picking up a coin)

**Grasp Quality Metrics**:
- **Number of contacts**: More contact points = more stable
- **Friction available**: Smooth surfaces are harder to grip
- **Robustness**: Can the grasp tolerate small errors in object position?

#### Manipulation Strategy

A robot manipulating objects must account for:
- **Object dynamics**: How the object moves when you apply force
- **Backlash**: Mechanical slack in joints that causes errors
- **Compliance**: How the robot arm bends under load (nothing is perfectly rigid)

**Example**: A robot opening a door
- **See**: Recognize the door handle
- **Plan**: Determine how much force and motion needed
- **Act**: Grasp the handle with appropriate grip strength
- **Adapt**: Feel resistance, adjust force if needed
- **Execute**: Turn the handle, pull, open the door

## Hands-On Section

### Exercise 1: Workspace Analysis

A robot arm has:
- Shoulder joint: Can rotate ±180°
- Elbow joint: Can rotate ±90°
- Wrist joint: Can rotate ±180°
- Upper arm length: 0.3m
- Forearm length: 0.2m
- Gripper length: 0.1m

**Questions**:
1. What is the **maximum reach** of this arm? (Straight out)
2. What is the **minimum reach**? (Closest point to the shoulder)
3. Can the gripper reach a point 0.2m directly above the shoulder? How?
4. Is there a position where the elbow joint can't rotate further? (This is a singularity.)

### Exercise 2: Friction and Acceleration

A robot wheel is 0.1m in radius and has maximum torque of 5 Nm. The robot body (without wheels) weighs 10 kg.

The coefficient of friction between wheel and ground is 0.5.

**Calculate**:
1. Maximum friction force = μ × m × g = 0.5 × 10 × 10 = 50 N
2. Motor torque → Wheel force = Torque / radius = 5 / 0.1 = 50 N
3. Is the robot **limited by motor power** or **limited by friction**? (They're balanced!)
4. **What happens if you try to accelerate faster?** (Wheels slip)

### Exercise 3: Grasp Design Challenge

You're designing a robotic gripper to handle:
- Soft objects: bread, fruit (max 5 N force)
- Hard objects: boxes, cans (needs 50 N to prevent slipping)

**Challenges**:
1. Can a single gripper strength handle both? Why or why not?
2. How would a **feedback-controlled gripper** (measuring force) solve this?
3. What if the object is irregularly shaped?

## Practice & Reflection Questions

2. **Compare** wheeled and legged robots. When would you choose each? What are the trade-offs?

3. **Analyze** a robotic grasper trying to pick up an egg without crushing it. What sensor feedback is essential?

4. **Design** a locomotion strategy for a robot that must navigate both smooth hallways and rocky outdoor terrain.

5. **Reflect**: Why do robot arms with longer reaches require stronger (more expensive) motors? Use physics to explain.
